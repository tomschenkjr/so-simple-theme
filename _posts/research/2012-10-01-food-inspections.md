City of Chicago has limited number of food inspections--approximately 32--to inspect nearly 15,000 food establishments. This project used machine learning to determine which food establishment was most likely to have a critical violations and, therefore, should be inspected first. After conducting a citywide experiment, inspectors found critical violations 25 percent faster. 

The entire project is open source and the data is available online. It was one of the first open-source predictive analytics project led by a city which also used the burgoning open data portals. The code can be adapted to other cities or code improvements can be submitted.
